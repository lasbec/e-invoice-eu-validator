## Description

When issuing or receiving electronic invoices, it is a good idea to validate
them against the corresponding schemas. One software that you can use for this
purpose is [MustangProject](https://github.com/ZUGFeRD/mustangproject) which
comes with a CLI.

The problem with the CLI is that it starts up very slowly and can validate
only one document at a time. This server offers the validation
features of MustangProject as a minimal server API. This allows performant
batch validation of invoices.

It also avoids privacy issues because the invoices do not have to be sent
over the internet to third-party services.

## Generating Invoices

This project is a sister project of
[E-Invoice-EU](https://github.com/gflohr/e-invoice-eu). See
[there](https://github.com/gflohr/e-invoice-eu) for information about how to
*create* electronic invoices.

## Starting the Server

### Released Version

Download a `validator-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar` file from the
[releases page](https://github.com/gflohr/e-invoice-eu-validator/releases).

Then run the server

```shell
PORT=8080 java -jar target/validator-2.21.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

Inspect the sources if you want to run a jar file without dependencies.

### In Development Mode

```shell
mvn clean install
PORT=8080 mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.cantanea.validator.App
```

## API Usage

The service has one single endpoint `/validate`. It takes one single URL
parameter `invoice` that contains the invoice file.

```shell
curl -v -X POST -Finvoice=@invoice.xml http://localhost:8080/validate
```

This would validate the invoice in the file `invoice.xml`. The hybrid
formats Factur-X resp. ZUGFeRD can also be validated:

```shell
curl -v -X POST -Finvoice=@invoice.pdf http://localhost:8080/validate
```

If the document is valid, you will receive a response with a status code of 200.
For invalid documents, 400 is sent.

The output is an XML validation report, for example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<validation filename="invoice.xml" datetime="2025-04-25 13:36:39">
  <xml>
    <info>
      <version>2</version>
      <profile>urn:cen.eu:en16931:2017#compliant#urn:xeinkauf.de:kosit:xrechnung_3.0</profile>
      <validator version="2.16.4"/>
      <rules>
        <fired>13</fired>
        <failed>0</failed>
      </rules>
      <duration unit="ms">776</duration>
    </info>
    <summary status="valid"/>
  </xml>
  <summary status="valid"/>
</validation>
```

For the hybrid Factur-X/ZUGFeRD formats, you will see three summaries; the
first one for the PDF validation, the second one for the validation of the
embedded XML, and the third one for that overall status:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<validation filename="invoice.pdf" datetime="2025-04-25 14:36:22">
  <pdf>ValidationResult [flavour=3b, totalAssertions=6686, assertions=[], isCompliant=true]
    <info>
      <signature>unknown</signature>
      <duration unit="ms">1723</duration>
    </info>
    <summary status="valid"/>
  </pdf>  
  <xml>
    <info>
      <version>2</version>
      <profile>urn:cen.eu:en16931:2017#conformant#urn:factur-x.eu:1p0:extended</profile>
      <validator version="null"/>
      <rules>
        <fired>69</fired>
        <failed>0</failed>
      </rules>
      <duration unit="ms">1217</duration>
    </info>
    <summary status="valid"/>
  </xml>
  <summary status="valid"/>
</validation>
```
